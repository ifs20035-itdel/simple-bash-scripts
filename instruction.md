# UPCOMING FEATURE to ADD

File Organizer:
The script would scan a specified directory and identify files based on their extensions.
It would create separate folders for each file type (e.g., "Documents," "Images," "Videos").
The script would then move the files into their respective folders based on their extensions.
This helps to keep a directory organized and makes it easier to locate specific files.


Backup Tool:
The script would allow users to specify which files or directories they want to back up.
It would provide options for choosing the destination, such as an external drive or a remote location (e.g., FTP server).
The script could also offer scheduling options to automate regular backups.
Incremental backups can be implemented to only backup files that have changed since the last backup, reducing storage requirements and backup time.


System Monitor:
The script would gather system information using command-line tools like top, free, df, and ifconfig.
It would display real-time information about CPU usage, memory usage, disk space usage, and network statistics.
The script could update the information periodically, allowing users to monitor system performance and resource usage.


Password Generator:
The script would prompt users to specify password criteria such as length, inclusion of special characters, and avoidance of common patterns.
It would generate a strong password based on the specified criteria using a combination of random characters.
The script might utilize tools like pwgen or generate passwords using built-in Bash functions.


Command-line Todo List:
The script would allow users to manage a todo list from the command line.
It would provide options for adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, and removing tasks.
The script could support features like displaying the entire list, filtering tasks based on status, and sorting tasks by priority or due date.
Task data could be stored in a text file, with the script parsing and modifying the file as needed.
